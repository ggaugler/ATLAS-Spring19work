# ATLAS_singletop_research
Repository for my ATLAS research using deep learning to separate ttbar and tW collisions.

Part of a study applying machine learning techniques to particle physics analysis. 
Using data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, I created densely connected neural networks
to separate single top tW events from top anti-top ttbar events. The goal of this study is to compare these neural networks' performance
with that of boosted decision trees (BDTs) used by ATLAS to separate these events. 

My paper on this study is in the process of being published as an ATLAS document, I will upload the paper here once that is finished.
